## So, What are Cloud GPUs?

Let's start with GPUs to get a better grasp on cloud GPUs.

Graphics processing units (GPUs) are specialized electronic circuitry that can rapidly alter and manipulate memory to expedite the generation of images and graphics.

Modern graphics processing units are more effective at image and computer graphics manipulation than conventional central processing units (CPUs) due to their parallel structure (CPUs). The central processing unit (CPU) die, the PC's video card, or the motherboard could all house a GPU.

Massive artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning tasks can be executed in the cloud using cloud graphics processing units (GPUs). In order to use this function, a GPU is not required.

Popular GPU manufacturers include AMD, NVIDIA, Radeon, and GeForce.
