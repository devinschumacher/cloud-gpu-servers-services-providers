# Cloud GPUs: Servers, Providers & Everything You Would Ever Want Ya Dingus!

Your company's GPU computing strategy is essential whether you engage in 3D visualization, machine learning, AI, or any other form of intensive computing.

There was a time when businesses had to wait for long periods of time while deep learning models were being trained and processed. Because it was time-consuming, costly, and created space and organization problems, it reduced their output.

This problem has been resolved in the most recent GPU designs. Because of their high parallel processing efficiency, they are well-suited for handling large calculations and speeding up the training of your AI models.

When it comes to deep learning, GPUs can speed up the training of neural networks by a factor of 250 compared to CPUs, and the latest generation of cloud GPUs is reshaping data science and other emerging technologies by delivering even greater performance at a lower cost and with the added benefits of easy scalability and rapid deployment.

This article will provide an overview of cloud GPUs, their applications in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning, and the top cloud GPU deployment platforms available today.

## So, What are Cloud GPUs?

Let's start with GPUs to get a better grasp on cloud GPUs.

Graphics processing units (GPUs) are specialized electronic circuitry that can rapidly alter and manipulate memory to expedite the generation of images and graphics.

Modern graphics processing units are more effective at image and computer graphics manipulation than conventional central processing units (CPUs) due to their parallel structure (CPUs). The central processing unit (CPU) die, the PC's video card, or the motherboard could all house a GPU.

Massive artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning tasks can be executed in the cloud using cloud graphics processing units (GPUs). In order to use this function, a GPU is not required.

Popular GPU manufacturers include AMD, NVIDIA, Radeon, and GeForce.
